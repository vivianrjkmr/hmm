# Hidden Markov Model

This repository contains the code for a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) built from scratch (using Numpy). The code addresses the three fundamental problems of HMMs: **likelihood**, **decoding**, and **learning**.

### Project structure

This project is organised as follows.

```
.
├── Hidden Markov Model.ipynb           # notebook to display HMM features
├── hmm.py                              # script containing the core HMM class
└── README.md
```
